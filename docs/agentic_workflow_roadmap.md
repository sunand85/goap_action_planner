# Agentic Workflow Orchestrator: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation roadmap for the Agentic Workflow Orchestrator based on Goal Oriented Action Planning (GOAP) with A* pathfinding. The roadmap is divided into phases, each focusing on specific components and functionality.

## Phase 1: Core Framework (Week 1-2)

### Goals
- Set up the project structure
- Implement core interfaces and abstract classes
- Create basic unit tests

### Tasks
1. Set up Java project with Maven/Gradle
2. Implement core interfaces:
   - `WorldState` interface and `HashMapWorldState` implementation
   - `Action` interface and `BaseAction` abstract class
   - `Condition` and `Effect` interfaces and implementations
   - `Goal` interface and `SimpleGoal` implementation
   - `Plan` class
3. Create unit tests for core interfaces
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Phase 2: A* and GOAP Implementation (Week 3-4)

### Goals
- Implement the A* algorithm for action planning
- Create the GOAP planner
- Develop heuristic functions

### Tasks
1. Implement `AStarPathfinder` class
2. Create `HeuristicFunction` interface and implementations:
   - `SimpleHeuristic` (counts unsatisfied conditions)
   - `CompositeHeuristic` (combines multiple heuristics)
3. Implement action chain analysis for better heuristics
4. Develop `GOAPPlanner` class
5. Create unit tests for A* and GOAP components
6. Implement plan validation

## Phase 3: Action Framework (Week 5-6)

### Goals
- Implement specialized action types
- Create the action repository
- Develop action factories and builders

### Tasks
1. Implement action types:
   - `LLMAction` for language model interactions
   - `HTTPAPIAction` for API calls
   - `MCPToolAction` for MCP tool calls
   - `BusinessLogicAction` for custom logic
2. Create `ActionRepository` interface and implementation
3. Develop action factories and builders for easy action creation
4. Implement action result handling
5. Create unit tests for action framework

## Phase 4: Execution Engine (Week 7-8)

### Goals
- Implement sequential execution pipeline
- Add parallel execution capabilities
- Create execution monitoring and reporting

### Tasks
1. Implement `ExecutionEngine` interface and `DefaultExecutionEngine` implementation
2. Create `ExecutionListener` interface for monitoring execution
3. Implement `ParallelExecutionManager` for parallel action execution
4. Develop `ActionGroup` for grouping parallelizable actions
5. Create execution reporting and logging
6. Implement failure handling and recovery
7. Create unit tests for execution engine

## Phase 5: Workflow Orchestrator (Week 9-10)

### Goals
- Implement the workflow orchestrator
- Add plan transition handling
- Create self-reflection capabilities

### Tasks
1. Implement `WorkflowOrchestrator` interface and `DefaultWorkflowOrchestrator` implementation
2. Create `UserRequest` class for handling user requests
3. Implement plan transition strategies
4. Develop plan merging capabilities
5. Add self-reflection through specialized actions
6. Create unit tests for workflow orchestrator
7. Implement end-to-end tests

## Phase 6: Integration and Examples (Week 11-12)

### Goals
- Create example applications
- Add integration with external systems
- Develop documentation and tutorials

### Tasks
1. Create example applications:
   - Support agent example
   - Financial operator example
   - Reason And Act workflow example
2. Implement integrations:
   - LLM client integration
   - API client integration
   - MCP tool integration
3. Create comprehensive documentation
4. Develop tutorials and guides
5. Create performance benchmarks

## Phase 7: Advanced Features (Week 13-14)

### Goals
- Add advanced features
- Optimize performance
- Enhance robustness

### Tasks
1. Implement dynamic goal adjustment
2. Add visualization tools for plan execution
3. Create performance metrics and optimization
4. Enhance error handling and recovery
5. Add support for distributed execution
6. Implement caching and optimization strategies

## Phase 8: Testing and Deployment (Week 15-16)

### Goals
